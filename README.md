# Face Mask Detection
<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus. 
The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes.
At this time, there are no specific vaccines or treatments for COVID-19.</p>

<p> To stop the spread of corona virus, social distancing and observing hygiene standards like compulsory wearing of mask, use of hand gloves, face shield, use of sanitizer and washing hands frequently is very important.</p>
<p> This project focuses on detecting face mask using OpenCV and python.</p>
